You play a trillionair Elon Bloomberg 

You invest in six kinds of organizations across 8 countries


Box types
- political party
- media outlet
- corporation
- NGO
- university
- local government

Each row is a country
- left box has the country's carbon level and
- the number of institutions needed to control the country and gain access to its resource
- Resources you get when you control country

+3PC <= Carbon Points
3/5  <= Institutions Controled / Institutions Needed For Control
# %  <= Nation Symbols

Each row / country has two resources
- you gain the resource with x numer of agents in a country
- number of agents needed shown in left most box
- resource types
  - Army
  - Navy
  - Inteligence Agency
  - Space Program
  - Alliance System

Place agents on boxes on the board to control institutions
- Have a capability level
- Have a support level
  - when support reaches 0, you no longer control the institution

Each non-country box has two letter codes
- Liability
- Capability

5 actions
- Add support - not cost
- Add capabilities - university + corportation
- Add card to deck - activist + media outlet 
- Remove card from deck - activist + political party
- Pick next card - economy + army + intel agency

Carbon reduction
- card appears: -1 carbon for any country with level x in box type y

Disasters
- Neutralization boxes deploy when you hit a certain carbon level

Calculate carbon every turn
- countries can have negative carbon levels via sequestration
  

Climate Game
1) Each box has a carbon emmision value (CP value)
- Add to carbon total when country type color comes up in the deck
- Can reduce it (or go negative)
- Cards in deck reduce carbon when tech is above a certain level
2) Black box represents support
- lose policial support based on letter codes
3) Operations points become activist points
4) Info level becomes tech level
- Carbon reduction happens in countries with x level of tech
- -1 CP for each box above 3
- -2 CP for each box above 6
- -3 CP for each box equal to 9
5) Support goes to 0 - but not eliminated
- Cannot add tech at 0
- Can add support
6) agents become activists
